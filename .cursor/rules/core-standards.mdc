# Core Standards

- Validate inputs at boundaries; never trust client data.
- Enforce authn/authz server-side on every sensitive action.
- Avoid N+1 queries and unbounded reads; paginate and batch.
- Keep request paths non-blocking; push heavy work to jobs.
- Handle errors explicitly; log with context, avoid secrets.
- Add tests for new behavior, edge cases, and failure modes.

## Example: Error Handling

```typescript
// ❌ BAD
try {
  await service.run();
} catch {}

// ✅ GOOD
try {
  await service.run();
} catch (error) {
  logger.error("Service failed", { error });
  throw error;
}
```
